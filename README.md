Furniture Rental App

This is a marketplace app (Airbnb clone) built with Ruby on Rails. The application enables users to list, browse, and rent furniture items online, providing a seamless experience for both furniture owners and renters. Users can upload photos, set rental prices and availability, manage bookings, and communicate securely through the platform. The app includes user authentication, detailed product pages, booking management, and administrative controls to ensure a safe and trustworthy environment.
